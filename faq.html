    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>What is an allotment?</h3>
      <p>An allotment is a small plot of land rented from a local authority or private landlord for growing fruit, vegetables and flowers. Plots are typically around 250 square metres but sizes vary.</p>
      <h3>How do I get an allotment?</h3>
      <p>Contact your local council or parish to join the waiting list. Demand for allotments is high in many areas, so you may need to wait for a plot to become available. Some private sites also rent plots directly.</p>
      <h3>How much does an allotment cost?</h3>
      <p>Rents vary depending on location and plot size, but a full plot in the UK usually costs between £30 and £80 per year. Some councils offer discounts for seniors or low‑income tenants.</p>
      <h3>Can I keep animals on my allotment?</h3>
      <p>Rules differ from site to site. Many allotments allow small numbers of hens or rabbits with permission, but livestock such as pigs or goats are generally not allowed. Always check the site regulations.</p>
      <h3>Do I need insurance?</h3>
      <p>Some councils require tenants to hold public liability insurance. Even if it's not mandatory, insurance is advisable to cover accidents or damage caused by your activities on the plot.</p>
      <h3>When can I visit my allotment?</h3>
      <p>Most sites permit access during daylight hours. Some have secure gates and require keys or codes. Respect any quiet hours stipulated by your site rules.</p>
      <h3>What can I grow?</h3>
      <p>Almost anything! Common crops include potatoes, onions, brassicas, roots, beans and fruit. Perennial plants such as rhubarb, strawberries and raspberries are also popular. Some sites restrict tall or invasive plants, so check with your site representative if unsure.</p>
