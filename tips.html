    <h2>Tips &amp; Tricks for a Productive Allotment</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>These tips draw on common gardening wisdom and research‑based advice to help you get the most from your plot.</p>
      <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
        <li><strong>Rotate your crops:</strong> Grow vegetables from different plant families in different beds each year to minimise pest and disease build‑up and maintain soil fertility.</li>
        <li><strong>Feed the soil:</strong> Add plenty of compost or well‑rotted manure to your beds each winter to improve structure and fertility. Healthy soil leads to healthy plants.</li>
        <li><strong>Sow little and often:</strong> For crops like lettuce, radishes and carrots, sow small batches every few weeks so you have a continuous supply rather than a glut all at once.</li>
        <li><strong>Use companion planting:</strong> Plant flowers such as marigolds and nasturtiums to attract pollinators and beneficial insects and to deter pests like aphids and whitefly.</li>
        <li><strong>Harvest regularly:</strong> Picking fruits and vegetables when they’re ready encourages plants to produce more. Beans, courgettes and cucumbers, for example, will stop cropping if left to mature fully on the plant.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect against extreme weather:</strong> Use cloches, fleece or polytunnels to protect seedlings from late frosts and to extend the season for tender crops. Provide shade and mulch in hot weather to conserve moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Water wisely:</strong> Water early in the morning or late in the evening to reduce evaporation. Focus on the root zone rather than wetting the foliage and use a watering can or drip line rather than a sprinkler.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep paths clear:</strong> Define your beds and paths clearly and keep paths weed‑free. This improves airflow around plants and makes the plot easier to manage.</li>
        <li><strong>Record your successes:</strong> Keep a diary of what you planted, where and when. Note the varieties that performed well and any problems you encountered so you can refine your plan each year.</li>
      </ul>
